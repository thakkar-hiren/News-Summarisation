        "#Text Summarization Using Doc2Vec Embeddings and TextRank Algorithm:\n",
        "This file contains an implementation of text summarization using Doc2Vec embeddings and the TextRank algorithm. The process begins by loading a dataset containing news articles and preprocessed text. The necessary libraries, including nltk, numpy, pandas, and gensim, are imported for data manipulation and modeling. The preprocessed text is tokenized into sentences using NLTK's sent_tokenize function, and each sentence is further tokenized into words using word_tokenize. The Doc2Vec model is trained on the tokenized corpus using Gensim's Doc2Vec class, with parameters such as vector size, window size, and minimum word count specified. The sentence embeddings are obtained by inferring vectors for each sentence using the trained Doc2Vec model. Cosine similarity is then used to construct a similarity matrix based on the sentence embeddings. The TextRank algorithm is applied to rank sentences based on their similarity scores, and the top-ranked sentences are selected to form the summary. The number of sentences in the summary is customizable, with options for generating summaries of 3 or 5 sentences. Additionally, the file includes evaluation functions to compute the average ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores, providing insights into the quality of the generated summaries. This implementation leverages Doc2Vec embeddings to capture semantic information and generate informative summaries, making it suitable for various text summarization tasks across different domains."

If we win MCD once, we will change Delhi so much in one year that you will compare Delhi to London,? he said.The CM said that people have the misconception that Delhi is not clean due to AAP government?s failure. ?Wherever I go, people have misconception that garbage is not being picked up and there is no cleaning because of Delhi government. It is not our but MCD?s responsibility,? he said.Kejriwal said the BJP and Congress have been leading the municipal bodies for the last 20 years without doing anything.?They have looted MCD. MCD collects so much money from house tax, hoarding, parking. Last year, Delhi government gave them Rs 2,800 crore. But where is all this money? Why is Delhi not being cleaned? They make the same road thrice on paper and eat all the money,? he said.Kejriwal said his government has been able to do many things in the last two years which the BJP-run governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have not been able to do in the last 10-15 years.?Before we came to power, the Delhi government had a policy of doing development activity in regularised colonies only. But we changed it. We said it doesn?t matter if the colony is regularised or not, people living there are humans and they need water, sewer, power, and road,? he said.Meanwhile, Congress workers led by former Uttam Nagar legislator Mukesh Sharma protested near the venue where Kejriwal was addressing the gathering. As they tried to show black flags, police stopped the protesters from reaching near the crowd. The protesters then burnt effigy of Kejriwal accusing the AAP government of ?cheating the city residents?. ?All these inaugurations are an eyewash. Incomplete sewer work is being inaugurated just because of the MCD polls. I got the sewerage work started in the area during my tenure,? Sharma said.\",\n          \"Pune, Jul 4 (PTI) Slamming the BJP for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today said the new tax system would not succeed and it would give rise to inflation as well as confusion. \\\"We were in favour of one slab of tax, that is 18 per cent and simple compliance procedure. However, the present structure of the GST they have created, it is certainly going to be an unsuccessful enterprise,\\\" he told reporters here. \\\"Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia is an honest man, but they are trying to implement the GST through impractical ways and with this kind of implementation, confusion will be created, which will initially give rise to inflation in the country....The GST will not be successful,\\\" he said. Singh was in the city after visiting Pandharpur in Solapur district in Maharashtra, where lakhs of devotees throng on the occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi celebrated today. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister also slammed the ruling BJP saying when it was in the opposition, the party had said that the GST will not be successful in the country, whereas it is now labelling the move as \\\"revolutionary\\\". \\\"Celebrations took place at midnight as if the country has got second freedom,\\\" Singh said. He added that the countries where the GST has become successful, have chosen a single tax slab structure. \\\"PM Modi is saying that it is good and simple tax, but it is not a reality. There are six slabs and petrol and liquor have been kept out of the GST and filing of tax returns have been made so complicated,\\\" he said. \\\"Previously, taxpayers used to file tax returns only four times, but now the same taxpayer will have to file tax 37 times and firms will have to appoint chartered accountants on a permanent basis,\\\" said Singh. \\\"The way demonetisation was implemented without printing of new notes, the same way they have now rolled out the GST without any preparation, as so far the returns formats are not available, there is a lack of infrastructure, such as internet connectivity, in remote areas,\\\" he alleged. Taking a dig at the prime minister, the Congress general secretary said, \\\"Modiji said that in order to eradicate black money, they have brought the GST, but alcohol which is the main source of black money, have been kept out of the GST.\\\" Accusing the BJP and RSS for inciting violence and creating a communal rift in the society, Singh alleged that \\\"targeted lynching\\\" of Muslims is the dangerous thing for the country. \\\"Modi tweets over small issues, but he did not tweet about the farmers, who were killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh. We want a prime minister, who does not have 56 inch chest, but who has a 56 inch heart,\\\" Singh said. Talking about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar supporting NDAs presidential nominee Ram Nath Kovind, the Congress leader said it was Kumar, who had fist pushed for the the unified oppositions candidate, although he later supported Kovind. While speaking on farmers condition in the country, Singh said demonetisation hit farmers in a big way. \\\"In Maharashtra, the state government announced the farm loan waiver. However, some farmers told me that the government has put a condition that farmers have to clear their outstanding loan, only after which they will get the loan waiver up to Rs 1.5 lakh,\\\" he said.

are yet to be announced . last time you gave us 67 seats but this time dont even leave the 3 seats . if we win mcd once we will change delhi so much in one year that you will compare delhi to london he said . the cm said that people have the misconception that delhi is not clean due to aap governments failure . wherever i go people have misconception that garbage is not being picked up and there is no cleaning because of delhi government . it is not our but mcds responsibility he said . kejriwal said the bjp and congress have been leading the municipal bodies for the last 20 years without doing anything . they have looted mcd . mcd collects so much money from house tax hoarding parking . last year delhi government gave them rs 2800 crore . but where is all this money why is delhi not being cleaned they make the same road thrice on paper and eat all the money he said . kejriwal said his government has been able to do many things in the last two years which the bjprun governments in madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh have not been able to do in the last 1015 years . before we came to power the delhi government had a policy of doing development activity in regularised colonies only . but we changed it . we said it doesnt matter if the colony is regularised or not people living there are humans and they need water sewer power and road he said . meanwhile congress workers led by former uttam nagar legislator mukesh sharma protested near the venue where kejriwal was addressing the gathering . as they tried to show black flags police stopped the protesters from reaching near the crowd . the protesters then burnt effigy of kejriwal accusing the aap government of cheating the city residents . all these inaugurations are an eyewash . incomplete sewer work is being inaugurated just because of the mcd polls . i got the sewerage work started in the area during my tenure sharma said .\",\n          \"pune jul 4 pti slamming the bjp for the goods and services tax gst rollout senior congress leader digvijaya singh today said the new tax system would not succeed and it would give rise to inflation as well as confusion . we were in favour of one slab of tax that is 18 per cent and simple compliance procedure . however the present structure of the gst they have created it is certainly going to be an unsuccessful enterprise he told reporters here . revenue secretary hasmukh adhia is an honest man but they are trying to implement the gst through impractical ways and with this kind of implementation confusion will be created which will initially give rise to inflation in the country . . . . the gst will not be successful he said . singh was in the city after visiting pandharpur in solapur district in maharashtra where lakhs of devotees throng on the occasion of ashadhi ekadashi celebrated today . the former madhya pradesh chief minister also slammed the ruling bjp saying when it was in the opposition the party had said that the gst will not be successful in the country whereas it is now labelling the move as revolutionary . celebrations took place at midnight as if the country has got second freedom singh said . he added that the countries where the gst has become successful have chosen a single tax slab structure . pm modi is saying that it is good and simple tax but it is not a reality . there are six slabs and petrol and liquor have been kept out of the gst and filing of tax returns have been made so complicated he said . previously taxpayers used to file tax returns only four times but now the same taxpayer will have to file tax 37 times and firms will have to appoint chartered accountants on a permanent basis said singh . the way demonetisation was implemented without printing of new notes the same way they have now rolled out the gst without any preparation as so far the returns formats are not available there is a lack of infrastructure such as internet connectivity in remote areas he alleged . taking a dig at the prime minister the congress general secretary said modiji said that in order to eradicate black money they have brought the gst but alcohol which is the main source of black money have been kept out of the gst . accusing the bjp and rss for inciting violence and creating a communal rift in the society singh alleged that targeted lynching of muslims is the dangerous thing for the country . modi tweets over small issues but he did not tweet about the farmers who were killed in firing in madhya pradesh . we want a prime minister who does not have 56 inch chest but who has a 56 inch heart singh said . talking about bihar chief minister nitish kumar supporting ndas presidential nominee ram nath kovind the congress leader said it was kumar who had fist pushed for the the unified oppositions candidate although he later supported kovind . while speaking on farmers condition in the country singh said demonetisation hit farmers in a big way . in maharashtra the state government announced the farm loan waiver . however some farmers told me that the government has put a condition that farmers have to clear their outstanding loan only after which they will get the loan waiver up to rs 1 . 5 lakh he said .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
