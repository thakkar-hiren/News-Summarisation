# Extractive Text Summarization Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various extractive text summarization techniques applied to the news summary dataset. Below are brief descriptions of each notebook:

1. **1_News_Summary.ipynb: EDA and Data Preprocessing**
   - Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing of the news summary dataset, including handling missing values and filtering data based on word and sentence counts.

2. **2_News_Summary.ipynb: Bigram + Text Rank**
   - Implements an extractive text summarization technique using bigrams and TextRank algorithm.

3. **3_News_Summary.ipynb: TF-IDF + Text Rank**
   - Applies the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting scheme along with the TextRank algorithm for extractive text summarization.

4. **4_News_Summary.ipynb: Word2Vec + Text Rank**
   - Utilizes Word2Vec embeddings in conjunction with the TextRank algorithm to generate extractive summaries.

5. **5_News_Summary.ipynb: GloVe + Text Rank**
   - Implements extractive text summarization using GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings and the TextRank algorithm.

6. **6_News_Summary.ipynb: BERT + Text Rank**
   - Applies the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model along with the TextRank algorithm for extractive text summarization.

7. **7_News_Summary.ipynb: Frequency Based**
   - Implements a frequency-based approach for extractive text summarization.

8. **8_News_Summary.ipynb: Doc2Vec + Text Rank**
   - Utilizes Doc2Vec embeddings in combination with the TextRank algorithm to generate extractive summaries.

Each notebook contains detailed explanations, code implementations, and evaluations of the respective extractive text summarization techniques. The preprocessing steps, algorithm implementations, and evaluation metrics are thoroughly documented to provide a clear understanding of each technique's performance.
